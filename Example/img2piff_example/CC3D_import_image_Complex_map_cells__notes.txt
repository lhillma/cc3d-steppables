The goal of this CC3D project is to;
1. read a bmp (or jpg, png, ...) image showing a cell layout (probably create in a simple drawing program)
2. convert the image into a set of cells in CC3D
3. save the resulting CC3D layout as a piff file


Need to install PIL

Note that if cell boundary display is turned on in Player then you may get the entire
field colored by the boarder color after all pixels in the image are made into individual cells.

Tested with formats:
1. gif: NO
2. jpg: OK
3. png: OK
4. bmp: OK

This version is for importing a cell field drawing and maping to CC3D cells.
The parameters, file names, colors etc. are in a "CC3D_import_image_Complex_map_cells_parameters.py" file

The drwaing should NOT be antialiased (aliasing fuzzy's up the borders).
Use Black for cell boundaries (boundaries are not needed between cells of different types tough it is 
easiest to have all teh cells with boundaries.

The image should be about the same pixel dimension that it will be used in CC3D. This code can not interpolate 
or extrapolate to fit the image into a CC3D window of different dimensions. It could put a smaller image into 
a larger CC3D windo though.


Use white for medium (255,255,255)
Use Black for cell boundaries (0,0,0)
Simple colors are a bit easier (though you can use any color), so start with red (255,0,0), green (0,255,0), blue (0,0,255),...
All cells of the same type should have the same color.
